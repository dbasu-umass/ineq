# ineq

The goal of ineq is to create a set of functions to compute various measures of economic inequality. You provide the data, choose the relevant function and the package will compute the measures.

## Basic Measures of Economic Inequality

The three main measures of inequality that is created by this package are the Lorenz curve, the coefficient of variation (CV) and the Gini coefficient (Gini). 

Consider a society with $j = 1, 2, \ldots, m$ income groups,  

- where $y_j$ is the mean income level in group $j$, 
- the groups are arranged in increasing order of mean income, i.e. $y_1 \leq y_2, \ldots, y_m$, and
- the number of persons in the groups are given by $n_1 \leq n_2, \ldots, n_m$.

Note that the total number of persons in this society is given by $$n = n_1 + n_2 + \cdots + n_m$$ and the total income level in this society is given by $$y = n_1y_1 + n_2 y_2 + \cdots + n_my_m$$

### Lorenz Curve

The most important measure of inequality is the Lorenz curve, which is a plot of the cumulative income share against the cumulative population share. To construct this plot, we first create a table of the two variables, the cumulative income share and the cumulative population share.

Let $w_j = n_j/n$ denote the population share and $s_j=n_jy_j/y$ denote the income share of the $j$-th group. Then the cumulative population share is given by $cw_j = \sum_{i=1}^{j}w_i$ and the cumulative income share is given by $cs_j = \sum_{i=1}^{j}s_i$. Now consider the plane where $cw$ is measured on the horizontal axis and $cs$ is measured on the vertical axis. A line plot of $cs$ against $cw$ is called the *Lorenz curve*. 

Since both $cs$ and $cw$ lies between $0$ and $1$, the Lorenz curve fits within a square whose side is of length $1$ (or 100, if the shares are measured in percentages). 

### Coefficient of Variation

The mean income level is given by $$\mu = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=1}^{m} n_j y_j = \sum_{j=1}^{m} w_j y_j $$ and the variance of the income level is given by $$\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=1}^{m} n_j \left(y_j-\mu \right)^2 = \sum_{j=1}^{m} w_j \left(y_j-\mu \right)^2$$. If the income distribution is perfectly equal, then each group's income share is the same. In that case, the Lorenz curve is the $45$-degree line through the origin. As distributions of income become more unequal, the Lorenz curve bows out and away from the $45$-degree line.

The second measure of inequality is the coefficient of variation: $$CV=\sigma/\mu$$.

### Gini coefficient

The third measure of inequality is the Gini coefficient: $$G = \frac{1}{2n^2 \mu} \sum_{j=1}^{m} \sum_{k=1}^{m} n_j n_k |y_j-y_k| = \frac{1}{2 \mu} \sum_{j=1}^{m} \sum_{k=1}^{m} w_j w_k |y_j-y_k|$$


### Data on shares

In many situations, researchers have access only to data on population shares and income shares of each group, i.e. $w_j$ and $s_j$, for $j=1,2, \ldots, m$. This allows us to draw the Lorenz curve. But how do we compute the CV and the Gini coefficient in this case?

Since $s_j=n_jy_j/y=n_jy_j/n\mu=w_jy_j/\mu$, we get $y_j=(s_j/w_j)\mu$. Using this, we see that the variance of the income distribution is given by $$\sigma^2 = \sum_{j=1}^{m} w_j \left(y_j-\mu \right)^2 = \sum_{j=1}^{m} \mu^2 w_j \left(\frac{s_j}{w_j}-1 \right)^2 = \mu^2 \sum_{j=1}^{m}  w_j \left(\frac{s_j}{w_j}-1 \right)^2$$. Hence, the coefficient is variation is given by $$CV=\frac{\sigma}{\mu}=\sum_{j=1}^{m}  w_j \left(\frac{s_j}{w_j}-1 \right)^2$$

In a similar way, using $y_j=(s_j/w_j)\mu$, we see that the Gini coefficient is given by $$G = \frac{1}{2n^2 \mu} \sum_{j=1}^{m} \sum_{k=1}^{m} n_j n_k |y_j-y_k| = \frac{1}{2 \mu} \sum_{j=1}^{m} \sum_{k=1}^{m} w_j w_k |(s_j/w_j)-(s_k/w_k)|$$

## Installation

You can install the development version of ineq from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("dbasu-umass/ineq")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(ineq)
## basic example code

y2011r <- c(521.44,665.84,783.24,904.57,1017.80,
            1135.97,1266.08,1426.76,1645.36,2007.46,
            2556.33,4481.18)

w2011r <- c(0.05,0.05,rep(0.1,8),0.05,0.05)

myresults <- ineq1(y=y2011r, w=w2011r)

```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
# Coefficient of variation
myresults$CV

# Gini coefficient
myresults$Gini

```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(myresults$lzcurve)
```
